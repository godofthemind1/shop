                    <p>Hemp has been cultivated for over 10,000 years, making it one of humanity's oldest domesticated crops. Throughout history, this remarkable plant has provided food, fiber, medicine, and building materials across civilizations. Despite its historical significance, hemp faced decades of prohibition due to its botanical relationship with marijuana, despite containing negligible amounts of THC.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, we're witnessing a global hemp renaissance as modern science confirms what ancient cultures knew: hemp offers extraordinary environmental and health benefits. As climate change intensifies and consumers seek sustainable alternatives, hemp stands as a beacon of hope‚Äîa carbon-negative crop that can replace environmentally harmful materials while supporting local economies.</p>
                    
                    <p>At Eco Hemp, we're committed to harnessing hemp's full potential through innovative products that promote planetary and personal well-being. We partner with organic farmers who use regenerative practices, creating a virtuous cycle that heals the land while producing exceptional hemp. Join us in rediscovering this remarkable plant's potential for our modern world.</p>

                    <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
                    <p>Hemp is a regenerative crop that grows rapidly without pesticides, requires minimal water, and leaves the soil healthier than before. A single acre of hemp can absorb up to 15 tons of CO2, making it a powerful tool against climate change. Its deep root system prevents soil erosion, while its dense growth naturally suppresses weeds. By choosing hemp products, you're directly supporting agricultural practices that heal rather than harm our planet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-item">
                    <div class="benefit-icon">üíß</div>
                    <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Unlike cotton, which demands extensive irrigation, hemp thrives with minimal water input. Studies show hemp requires approximately 50% less water than cotton to produce the same amount of fiber. In an era of increasing water scarcity, hemp's natural drought resistance represents a crucial adaptation strategy for sustainable agriculture. Our hemp is grown using precision irrigation techniques that further minimize water usage.</p>

                    <h3>Health & Wellness</h3>
                    <p>Hemp-derived cannabinoids like CBD interact with the body's endocannabinoid system, which regulates crucial functions including sleep, stress response, and immune activity. Research suggests these compounds may help manage anxiety, inflammation, and sleep disorders without psychoactive effects. Meanwhile, hemp seeds represent one of nature's most nutritionally complete foods, containing ideal ratios of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, along with all nine essential amino acids, fiber, and minerals like magnesium and zinc.</p>

                    <h3>Economic Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>The global hemp market is projected to reach $15 billion by 2027, creating opportunities throughout the supply chain from farming to manufacturing. Unlike many commodities, hemp can be processed locally, revitalizing rural economies and creating skilled jobs. With over 25,000 potential applications, hemp represents a significant opportunity for sustainable economic development. Our company partners with family farms, ensuring fair compensation while supporting local communities.</p>

                    <p>At Eco Hemp, sustainability isn't just a marketing term‚Äîit's embedded in every aspect of our operations. We believe that business can and should be a force for environmental regeneration and social good. This philosophy guides our decisions from seed to shelf.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our hemp is cultivated using regenerative agricultural practices that build soil health, increase biodiversity, and sequester carbon. We work exclusively with farmers who avoid synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, instead leveraging hemp's natural resilience and companion planting techniques. This approach not only produces superior hemp but also creates habitats for pollinators and beneficial insects.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our manufacturing processes are designed to minimize waste and energy consumption. We use solar power in our production facilities, compostable packaging derived from hemp itself, and water-based inks for labeling. Any production residues are composted or repurposed, creating a closed-loop system that mimics natural cycles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond our products, we invest in hemp research and advocate for policies that support sustainable agriculture. We believe transparency is essential to sustainability, which is why we publish annual impact reports detailing our environmental footprint and social initiatives. By choosing Eco Hemp, you're not just purchasing a product‚Äîyou're supporting a vision for a more sustainable and equitable world.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. While both hemp and marijuana are varieties of Cannabis sativa, they are distinct in their chemical composition and uses. Hemp contains less than 0.3% THC (the psychoactive compound), meaning it cannot produce intoxicating effects. Hemp is cultivated specifically for industrial and wellness applications rather than recreational use.</p>

                        <p>In most countries, including the United States, hemp and hemp-derived products containing less than 0.3% THC are legal. The 2018 Farm Bill federally legalized hemp cultivation and processing in the US. However, regulations regarding specific hemp products, especially CBD, vary by state and country.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Hemp fabric offers several advantages over cotton: it's approximately four times stronger, more breathable, naturally resistant to mold and UV damage, and requires significantly less water and no pesticides to grow. Hemp clothing initially feels crisp but softens with each wash without losing durability. It's also more effective at temperature regulation, keeping you cooler in summer and warmer in winter.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Hemp's sustainability comes from multiple factors: it grows quickly (reaching maturity in 3-4 months), requires minimal water and no pesticides, improves soil health through phytoremediation, prevents erosion with its deep root system, sequesters more CO2 than many forests, and can be used completely with no waste. One acre of hemp produces as much fiber as 2-3 acres of cotton while requiring a fraction of the resources.</p>
